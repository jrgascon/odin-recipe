    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish made with alternating layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, rich meat or vegetable ragù, creamy béchamel sauce, and melted cheese (typically mozzarella and Parmesan). The layers are baked until golden and bubbly, creating a comforting, hearty casserole with a perfect balance of textures—tender pasta, savory filling, and crispy cheese topping. It's a beloved comfort food worldwide, often served at family gatherings and special occasions.</p>
